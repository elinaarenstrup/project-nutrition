# Project Nutrition

Build an app which scans barcodes on food packages to retrieve the product name and ingredients.

## The problem

The app was built based on a Quagga component provided by Technigo. We have created a Redux store and reducers to be able to store product information of the scanned product using useDispatch and retreive the information we wanted to display using useSelector. The app is styled using Styled Components.

We pair-programmed using the VS Live Share extension, taking turns to code. If we were to continue working on the projects, we would like to incorporate React Router.
